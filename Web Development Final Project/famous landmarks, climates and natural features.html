    <p><b>In this section of the webpage you will learn about Italys unique climates.</b></p>
    <p>The climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po Valley geographical region is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany and most of the South experience a Mediterranean climate according to the Köppen climate classification. </p> 
    <p>Between the north and south there can be a considerable difference in temperature, above all during the winter: on some winter days it can be −2 °C (28 °F) and snowing in Milan, while it is 8 °C (46.4 °F) in Rome and 20 °C (68 °F) in Palermo. Temperature differences are less extreme in the summer. On 11 August 2021, an agricultural monitoring station near Syracuse recorded 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) which constitutes the official record of the highest temperature in Europe according to the World Meteorological Organization.  </p>
    <p>Italy is experiencing widespread impacts of climate change, with an increase in extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts and more frequent flooding. For example, Venice is facing increasing issues due to sea level rise. Italy faces many challenges adapting to climate change including the economic, social, and environmental impacts that climate change creates, and an increasingly problematic death toll from the health risks that come with climate change. </p>

    <h3>Famous Landmarks:</h3> 
<p>Italy has so many tourist landmarks that are very well known and famous around the world that people often use as tourist attractions. Obviously, there is far too many landmarks in Italy to be listed here but let's explain and show the greatest landmarks of Italy. The first famous landmark is one that is most likely known by most. The leaning Tower of Piza, this incredible landmark, has been a famous tourist attraction for a very long time. Back in the 12th century, the city of Pisa wanted to make a very tall tower because they wanted more amazing-looking buildings. Unfortunately, the building never got past the fourth floor because it was beginning to lean due to poor building conditions.</p>
  <p>The next Landmark that should be brought up is the coliseum, which is also an extremely famous landmark from Italy. The Coliseum has been a very famous place ever since it was originally built. The coliseum has a very long history, but the reason a lot of it is broken is used for building material way back in the past. The final attraction that will be explained is The Pantheon. The Pantheon is a beautiful tourist attraction nowadays and it was built as a temple during 27bce, which makes it more than 2000 years old. The pantheon room currently is still standing strong. </p>

    <p><b>in this section of this webpage you will learn about The many unique natural features </b></p>
    <p>For 22 centuries, Italians and their ancestors have cleared fields, grazed livestock, and hunted wild animals. Forests that once covered large areas are gone. But the country's remote places and many national parks still have wilderness largely untouched by humans.</p>
<p>The lower slopes of Italy's Alps are covered with forests. Above these woodlands are meadows that explode with specially adapted wildflowers in the spring. Throughout Italy, millions of birds stop to rest during their annual migration to Africa. </p>
